Experience
==========

Platform Developer (Java), [AMEE](http://www.amee.com), London 01/2012 - Today
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My role includes both software development and systems architecture.  I am responsible for implementation of the back-end, but design the architecture for the entire system, including infrastructure, persistence, application architecture and messaging, and the accompanying systems and processes - TDD, continuous integration, deployment strategies, scalability and resilience, and security.  This includes specifications for external vendors, and integration with their systems.  My 2-person development team builds the core business platform supporting data access, providing RESTful APIs, batch database extracts and data analysis tooling.  It is both a rewarding and demanding position; I am consulted as the domain expert on application architecture and development practices.

In this role I’ve worked on an existing emissions calculation platform and delivered a highly scalable data collection system.  I am currently working on a business supply-chain risk analysis platform; having recently completed architectural plans for the initial phases of delivery, I am now implementing the back-end components.

Associate Vice President, Developer, [Markit](http://www.markit.com), London, 01/2011 - 01/2012
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At Markit I was working in an international team  with a focus on development of financial indices.  An understanding of both our technology and business was essential in this role as it involved working closely with analysts in both the UK and US.  An agile development methodology ensured a focus on deliverables.  We ran a monthly release cycle, providing time estimates on specifications and then designing, building and testing the code.  I also had responsibilities for maintenance and support of the entire codebase of the team, as well as deployment and disaster recovery.  The team was highly client-focused, and the company is rapidly taking market share from established competitors, so I am expected to demonstrate proficiency in our products, effectively articulating my progress to all members of the team, and I expect the same from my colleagues; I have found this type of development provides a stimulating and rewarding environment.  My key projects were supporting index products, providing performance analysis of complex structured financial instruments for investors.
 

Senior Applications Developer (Portal), [University of the West of England](http://www.uwe.ac.uk), Bristol, 01/2009 – 12/2010
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working in the Academic Technologies Group (ATG) within IT Services, my immediate team of 7 was responsible for delivery of a student web portal [myUWE](http://my.uwe.ac.uk), providing a full online environment for student activities, from initial registration and payment of fees (>£2m in 2010), through accessing the virtual learning environment, submitting coursework, receiving results and supporting functionality such as email and faculty announcements as well as teaching and exam timetables.  The portal was (and still is) the primary means of accessing these services, making it a critical part of the student experience at UWE.  The university has around 28,000 student and 3000 staff users, with around 8000 distinct logins per day; data protection therefore numbers among my responsibilities.  The role requires that I am an expert in the platform we use – Jasig’s uPortal - and its optimisation and maintenance.  During my time at UWE I was promoted to Senior Developer, gaining responsibility for security, performance, development processes, technical documentation and also leading system maintenance.  I enjoyed advising on technology and liasing with all levels of stakeholder, from students to senior management.  Whilst in this post I actively engaged in the open source community, exchanging technology and sharing knowledge with my contemporaries at other universities around the world.
