Senior Software Engineer, [Bright North](http://www.brightnorth.co.uk/), London 01/2014 - Today
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My current role requires both full-stack polyglot development and non-technical responsibilities, as a result of the size of the engineering capability - we're currently 8 strong.  My delivery team works on both client projects and internal products, with firm deadlines and a strong quality ethic.  Development methodology varies between these two streams, as building to a brief and iterating on a product require different approaches, but things are kept as agile as is appropriate and we use TDD on everything.  Pragmatism is king.  My typical workload consists of building applications and infrastructure to support Bright North's data visualisation projects, evaluating technologies, building proofs of concept, and writing proposals.  I'm usually found plugging together micro-services in the guts of a SaaS web application of some sort.

Tech stack: Highly variable, typically Angular / Clojure / MySQL / Chef

Software Engineer, [Softwire](http://www.softwire.com), London, 06/2013 - 01/2014
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At Softwire I delivered a project for the company's largest client, [Metaswitch](http://www.metaswitch.com/).  My team was around 8 people. The project's aim was to build a number of significant extensions to Metaswitch's existing global telecommunications platform, and so the work involved a major body of 3rd-party legacy code.  As well as providing experienced development resource to the project, I established effective processes to bridge the culture gap between the two companies; this rangesdfrom setting up git-svn, to introducing test infrastructure and a modern TDD development cycle.  In addition, I mentored less experienced developers, providing guidance in good coding practice as well as acting as a subject matter expert on the project application.  The project's development had a focus on performance and security, as each installation of the system handles several million subscribers, many of whom are concurrently using their mobile phones and other devices.  The main challenges are focused around the introduction of stronger dev practices to improve the speed and quality of delivery. 

Outside of my immediate project, I actively participate in company-wide learning and knowledge sharing, by writing internal blog posts and giving input on technical issues in our discussion forums, organising external speakers for regular "Lunch & Learn" sessions, and speaking at those sessions myself.

Tech stack: Java / Perl / MySQL / SQL Server  


Senior Platform Developer (Java), [AMEE](http://www.amee.com), London 01/2012 - 06/2013
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This role included both software development and systems architecture.  I was responsible for implementation of the back-end and design of the architecture for the entire system, including infrastructure, persistence, application architecture and messaging, and the accompanying systems and processes - BDD/TDD, continuous integration, deployment strategies, scalability and resilience, and security.  This includes specifications for external vendors, and integration with their systems.  My development team built the core business platform supporting data access, providing RESTful APIs, batch database extracts and data analysis tooling.  It is both a rewarding and demanding position; I am consulted as the domain expert on application architecture and development practices.

In this role I worked on an existing emissions calculation platform and delivered a highly scalable data collection system.  Starting in late 2012, the company began development of a business supply-chain risk analysis platform.  Before the end of my time at AMEE, I completed architectural plans for the initial phases of delivery, my team implemented the solution and saw it through to launch.

Tech stack: Groovy / Java / Jetty / Spring / Restlet / Hibernate / MySQL / Cassandra / Maven

Associate Vice President, Developer, [Markit](http://www.markit.com), London, 01/2011 - 01/2012
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At Markit I was working in an international team  with a focus on development of financial indices.  An understanding of both our technology and business was essential in this role as it involved working closely with analysts in both the UK and US.  An agile development methodology ensured a focus on deliverables.  We ran a monthly release cycle, providing time estimates on specifications and then designing, building and testing the features.  I also had responsibilities for maintenance and support of the entire codebase of the team, as well as deployment and DR.  My key projects were index products, providing performance analysis of various structured financial instruments for investors.

Tech stack: Java / Tomcat / Spring / JavaSpaces / Hibernate / Oracle / GWT / Maven
 

Senior Applications Developer (Portal), [University of the West of England](http://www.uwe.ac.uk), Bristol, 01/2009 – 12/2010
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working in the Academic Technologies Group within IT Services, my immediate team of 7 was responsible for delivery of a student web portal [myUWE](http://my.uwe.ac.uk), providing a full online environment for student activities, from initial registration and payment of fees (>£2m in 2010), through accessing the virtual learning environment, submitting coursework, receiving results and supporting functionality such as email and faculty announcements as well as teaching and exam timetables.  The portal was (and still is) the primary means of accessing these services, making it a critical part of the student experience at UWE.  The university at the time had around 28,000 student and 3000 staff users, with around 8000 distinct logins per day; data protection was important.  The role required an expert in the platform we use – JASIG’s uPortal - and its optimisation and maintenance.  During my time at UWE I was promoted to Senior Developer, gaining responsibility for security, performance, development processes, technical documentation and also leading system maintenance. Whilst in this post I actively engaged in the open source community, exchanging technology and sharing knowledge with my contemporaries at other universities around the world.

Tech stack: Java / Tomcat / Spring / Portlet / TopLink / SQL Server / XSLT / Maven
